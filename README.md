# Chat-room-
A command line chat room service.

To run the service:

Run the server.py to create a server for the chat room and then run the client.py on any device you want (provided it is connected on the same network as the server).

Doing so would enable the client to communicate with the server and other clients. 
The client can exit by just typing "exit".
